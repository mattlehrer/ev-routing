 * For each CS, find the closest node on the route. These will be ai and bi.
 * Create nodes for each CS and battery level, 0-100%, every 10%.
 * These are ii, c0-100, and oi.
 * There are edges from ai to ii, ii to c0-100, c0-100 to oi, and oi to bi.
 * The costs of edges ii to c0-100 are based on the price of charging at the CS.
 * The costs of edges ai to ii and oi to bi are based on the distance between the CS and the node, assume 0 for now?
 * The costs of edges c0-100 are an overhead time cost (entering/leaving the vehicle, setting up payment, etc.)
